*DESCRIPTION* :
Spam detection is a crucial application of machine learning, designed to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content. Using Python in VS Code, you can build a machine learning model that processes email text data and identifies spam with high accuracy.
Steps to Implement Spam Detection
1) Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Use datasets like the Enron Spam Dataset or SpamAssassin Corpus.
- Clean email text by removing HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
- Convert emails into numerical format using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
2) Feature Extraction
- Use CountVectorizer or TF-IDF to convert text into vectors.
- Extract relevant features such as word frequency, email subject, and sender metadata.
3)Choosing the Machine Learning Model
  The best models for spam detection include:
- Na√Øve Bayes (great for text classification)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) (works well for binary classification)
- Random Forest (uses multiple decision trees)
- Deep Learning (LSTM or Transformer-based models for contextual understanding)
4) Training & Evaluation
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the model using labeled email data.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5) Deploying the Model
- Implement the model in Flask or FastAPI to integrate with email services.
- Test with real emails and fine-tune the model for better spam detection.
6)Libraries Used in VS Code
  For implementing this project in VS Code, the key libraries used include:
- Data Processing: pandas, numpy
- Natural Language Processing: nltk, spaCy, re (for regex-based text cleaning)
- Machine Learning Models: scikit-learn, tensorflow (for deep learning models)
- Feature Engineering: CountVectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer from sklearn
- Model Deployment: Flask, FastAPI
- Visualization & Debugging: matplotlib, seaborn
